# netlogo_distributions
This is a university project for Modelización de Sistemas Biológicos.

This program describes the North Pole where the penguins move following the main 3 types of population distribution: uniform, random and clumped. 

You must have Netlogo installed.
Instructions to run the program:
- Set the slider 'Numero e pingüinos' with the number desired.
- click on SETUP to create the world.
- Choose the movement that you desire to see:
    - Movimiento Aleatorio (random distribution)
    - Movimiento Agrupado (clumped distribution)
    - Movimiento Regular (uniform distribution)

This program will create an excel file as an output with the coordinates of the penguins location in the world.
